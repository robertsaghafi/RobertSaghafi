# Hi, I'm Robert Saghafi 👋

**Zero Trust Security Architect • Pilot • Strategic Advisor**

** Data Protection Engineering • Autonomous Systems Security**

Welcome to my GitHub. I build at the intersection of **Zero Trust security architecture, autonomous systems security, agentic AI protection, data-centric security, and GRC Engineering**.

This space is home to the **Zero Trust Autonomous Systems Portfolio (ZTASP)** — a growing collection of real-world, hands-on projects exploring how Zero Trust principles secure autonomous platforms, agentic AI systems, and mission-critical operations in contested environments.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

My work focuses on applied research and rapid prototyping across:

- **Zero Trust architecture for autonomous systems** (aerial, maritime, ground robotics)
- **Agentic AI security** with continuous verification and policy enforcement
- **Data-centric security** for autonomous vehicle telemetry and AI model pipelines
- **Supply chain security** for autonomous platforms and AI systems
- **Privacy-by-design** frameworks for GDPR/CCPA compliance in autonomous operations
- **Data quality and integrity** for autonomous and AI/ML operations
- **Mission assurance** and resilience for cyber-physical systems

Each project is designed to be **actionable, enterprise-ready, and grounded in NIST 800-207, CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, and DoD Zero Trust Strategy**.
