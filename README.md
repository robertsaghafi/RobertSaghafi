# Hi, I'm Robert Saghafi 👋  
### Cybersecurity Consultant • Cyber Threat Intelligence Practitioner • Strategic Advisor  
### Pilot • Uncrewed & Autonomous Systems Cybersecurity • Geopolitical Cyber Threat Intelligence • Detection Engineering

Welcome to my GitHub. I build at the intersection of **cybersecurity, autonomous systems, AI security, aviation, OSINT, and geopolitical threat intelligence**.

This space is home to the **Autonomous Threat Intelligence Portfolio Plan (ATIPP)** — a growing collection of real-world, hands-on projects exploring how cyber, autonomy, and geopolitics collide in modern conflict and critical infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Building  
My work focuses on applied research and rapid prototyping across:

- **UAS/C-UAS security architecture**  
- **AI-enabled autonomous cyber defense**  
- **Drone warfare analytics & conflict-zone intelligence**  
- **Geopolitical & cyber threat intelligence (CTI)**  
- **Cyber-physical attacks & mission-security modeling**  
- **Satellite imagery, AIS, and OSINT fusion**  
- **Regulatory and compliance intelligence for autonomous systems**  

Each project is designed to be actionable, visually rich, and grounded in real-world scenarios.

## ✈️ About Me  
I’m a cybersecurity entrepreneur, executive, and strategic consultant specializing in the design, evaluation, and implementation of autonomous cyber defense and mission-critical security architectures, with a focus on protecting **autonomous systems, aviation platforms, and mission-critical technologies**.

My work blends **cybersecurity, autonomy, AI/ML, geopolitics, and real-world threat intelligence** to build resilient systems that reflect how adversaries actually operate.

I’m currently developing a collection of open-source tools to support the next generation of cyber–autonomy defense and geopolitically-contextualized Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities.
